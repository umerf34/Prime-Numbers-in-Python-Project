# Prime-Numbers-in-Python-Project
 Prime numbers are an important concept not only in mathematics, but also in computer science, cryptography, and many other fields. The modern internet exists because different computers can communicate privately without interruption from malicious parties. Your information stays confidential precisely because of current cryptography algorithms that are based on enormous prime numbers. Very big prime numbers, in fact. During this Prime Numbers in Python project, youâ€™ll devise a program for identifying such numbers.
